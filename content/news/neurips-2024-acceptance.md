# Our Paper Accepted at NeurIPS 2024

We are thrilled to announce that our paper "Efficient Neural Architecture Search via Multi-Objective Optimization" has been accepted at NeurIPS 2024!

## Abstract

This work presents a novel approach to neural architecture search that simultaneously optimizes for multiple objectives including accuracy, latency, and energy consumption. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results while being 10x faster than previous approaches.

## Key Findings

- **Faster Search**: Reduced search time from 3 days to 7 hours
- **Better Performance**: Achieved 2.3% higher accuracy on ImageNet
- **Lower Resource Usage**: 40% reduction in energy consumption

## Team

Congratulations to the entire team who worked on this project:
- Dr. Jane Doe (Lead)
- Alice Johnson (PhD Student)
- Bob Williams (Research Engineer)

We look forward to presenting this work at NeurIPS in Vancouver this December!
