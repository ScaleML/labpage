Hi there! I am Pengcheng Wang, currently a first-year MSCS student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, supervised by Prof. Tong Zhang.

Prior to UIUC, I completed my Bachelor of Applied Science in Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto. During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to be guided by Dr. Alistair Johnson in healthcare AI research.

My current research interests center on Generative Models, with a particular focus on Large Language Models, Reinforcement Learning (Post-Training, inference-time scaling), and Multimodality.
