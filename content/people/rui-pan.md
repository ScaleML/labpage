Rui Pan is a second-year PhD student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, supervised by Professor Tong Zhang. Previously, he completed his B.S. at Peking University and earned his MPhil. at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

Ruiâ€™s research interests include optimization, acceleration and their applications in understanding the world. He is driven by the theoretical insights of optimization to accelerate the computation in multiple disciplines. He also has first-hand experience in developing acceleration packages, such as LMFlow (8.4K stars in GitHub) and ExtremeBERT, which serve as tools for different scientific fields, including astronomy and math.
