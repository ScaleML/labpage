Hello there, I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign under supervision of Professor Tong Zhang. I obtained a BSc degree in Data Science and Technology (DSCT) with a double major in Computer Science from the School of Science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).
