I am a research scientist at NVIDIA Research. I completed my Ph.D. at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, advised by Professor Tong Zhang. Previously, I was a visiting scholar at BLENDER LAB@UIUC, working with my amazing host, Professor Heng Ji. I was a research intern at ByteDance AI Lab with Dr. Hang Li and Dr. Xinsong Zhang, and at Sinovation Ventures AI Institute. During my undergraduate study, I interned at WING Group @ NUS and PKU, where I was fortunate to work with Prof. Min-Yen Kan and Prof. Xiaojun Wan. I am passionate about the research in pre-training, efficient-tuning, and alignment of large foundation models.
