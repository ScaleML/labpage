My research focuses on developing generative models that are not only more intelligent but also reliable. Specifc topics I am currently pursuing include continual learning, curriculum learning, and the design of memory structures and agentic frameworks.

Prior to joining UIUC, I received my Bachelors of Science degree in Computer Science at Duke University. I have worked as a quantitative trader at Optiver US LLC and Old Mission Capital, and as a software engineer at VectorShift, Amazon, and Vertex Protocol.
