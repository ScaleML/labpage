Hi! I am a second-year PhD student in Siebel School of Computing and Data Science, UIUC, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Tong Zhang. Prior to that, I did my undergraduate in School of Data Science, Fudan University, under the valued supervision of Professor Luo Luo. My research interest lies in the intersection of machine learning and optimization. Currently, I am particularly interested in designing practical algorithms for modern machine learning (e.g., training large language models) and exploring valid explanations for the effectiveness of practical algorithms.
