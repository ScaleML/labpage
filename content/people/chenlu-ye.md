I am a second-year Ph.D. student in computer science at UIUC, where I am fortunate to advised by Prof. Tong Zhang. Prior to this, I obtained a master's degree in IIP (AI) at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and received a B.S. in Statistics from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2021. Additionally, I was a visiting scholar in AGI LAB @ UCLA from 2023.08 to 2023.12, working with Prof. Quanquan Gu.

My research interests span the intersection of reinforcement learning for LLM post-training and decision making problems, with a particular emphasis on reasoning in post training of llm and muiti-turn agentic RL.
