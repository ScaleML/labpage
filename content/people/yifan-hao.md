I am a first-year Ph.D. student in computer science at UIUC, where I am fortunate to advised by Prof. Tong Zhang. Previously, I obtained a master's degree in mathematics in 2024 at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where my study was supported by the Hong Kong PhD Fellowship. Before that, I received a B.S. in Statistics from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2022.
