I am currently a third-year Ph.D. candidate in computer science at UIUC, working with Prof. Tong Zhang and Prof. Nan Jiang.

Prior to this, I received a master's degree in mathematics in 2023 from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where my study was supported by the Hong Kong PhD Fellowship. I enjoyed several fabulous years at the University of Science and Technology of China and obtained a B.S. in mathematics in 2021, where I worked closely with Prof. Cong Shen.
