# Neural Architecture Search

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is revolutionizing the way we design deep learning models. Our research focuses on developing efficient and scalable methods for automatically discovering optimal neural network architectures.

## Overview

Traditional neural network design relies heavily on human expertise and trial-and-error. Our NAS approach automates this process using:

- **Reinforcement Learning**: Training a controller to generate architectures that maximize validation performance
- **Evolutionary Algorithms**: Using genetic algorithms to evolve better architectures over generations
- **Gradient-based Methods**: Differentiable architecture search for efficient exploration

## Key Contributions

1. **Efficiency**: Reduced search time from days to hours through novel search strategies
2. **Performance**: Discovered architectures that outperform hand-designed models
3. **Transferability**: Architectures found on small datasets transfer well to larger problems

## Applications

- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing
- Speech Recognition
- Time Series Forecasting
