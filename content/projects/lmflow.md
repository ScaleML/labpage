An extensible, convenient, and efficient toolbox for finetuning large machine learning models, designed to be user-friendly, speedy and reliable, and accessible to the entire community.

## Introduction

The remarkable achievements of large foundation models, such as the expansive language models, have demonstrated their exceptional capacity to attain human-like intelligence that surpasses conventional methods. Despite their growing accessibility, these models still require fine-tuning to cater to specific tasks while maintaining their overall AI competency. We are pleased to introduce our lightweight toolkit, which features thoughtfully designed and easily scalable APIs. This tool simplifies the process of fine-tuning and inference of publicly available foundation models to maximize their effectiveness.

We have thoroughly tested this toolkit and are pleased to make it available under Github.
