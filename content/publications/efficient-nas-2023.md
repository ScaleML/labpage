# Efficient Neural Architecture Search via Parameter Sharing

**Authors**: Jane Doe, Alice Johnson, Robert Chen

**Venue**: International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2023

## Abstract

We propose a novel approach to neural architecture search that achieves state-of-the-art results while being orders of magnitude faster than existing methods. By sharing parameters across candidate architectures during the search process, we dramatically reduce computational requirements while maintaining search effectiveness.

## Key Contributions

1. **Parameter Sharing Strategy**: Novel weight sharing mechanism that enables efficient architecture evaluation
2. **Search Space Design**: Carefully crafted search space that balances expressiveness and efficiency
3. **Empirical Results**: Extensive experiments showing superior performance on multiple benchmarks

## Results

Our method achieves:
- 10x speedup compared to previous NAS methods
- State-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet
- Transferable architectures across different tasks
