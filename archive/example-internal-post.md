# Getting Started with Neural Architecture Search

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has revolutionized how we design deep learning models. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the fundamentals and show you how to get started.

## What is NAS?

NAS is an automated method for designing neural network architectures. Instead of manually crafting network layers, NAS algorithms explore the space of possible architectures to find optimal designs.

## Key Concepts

1. **Search Space**: The set of all possible architectures
2. **Search Strategy**: How we explore the search space
3. **Performance Estimation**: How we evaluate candidate architectures

## Example Code

Here's a simple example using Python:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SearchableBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, 3, padding=1)
        self.bn = nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.relu(self.bn(self.conv(x)))
```

## Mathematical Formulation

The objective function for NAS can be expressed as:

$$ \alpha^* = \arg\max_{\alpha} \mathcal{V}(w^*(\alpha), \alpha) $$

where $\alpha$ represents the architecture parameters.

## Next Steps

- Explore different search strategies
- Implement custom search spaces
- Benchmark on your datasets

Happy searching!
